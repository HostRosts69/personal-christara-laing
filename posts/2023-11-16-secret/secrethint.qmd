Recently, I updated my 404 page, but I have inturn lost my article about creating links and windows. I don't know where it has gone.

The article was about how I learned to create links to diffrent articles through JS code and I wanted to make a silly easter egg in the 404 page with it. But I can't find it any more.

If you find it then I'll be amazed, and hopefully it isn't glitched out.
