Save the file somewhere on your computer and then use the input-field below to select it.\n\n\nAfter you select your file, the max pack-total will appear here!\nThe relevant JavaScript file is here. Use the Web Inspector tool on your browser to identify the elements on the html page that are accessed by the code.\nNote: You do not have to implement any of your Eloquent JavaScript solutions in the browser.
