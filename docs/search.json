She had to get all her shots and had to have her collar and tags. It took awhile for all of it to come in and get done but It took long enough to get it all done for her. She stayed at my grandmother’s until it all went through. I think she stayed there for about 7 weeks in total as we waited for the conformation about her ESA status.\n\nGoing to the Vet:\nFirst was going to the vet though. At the vet she got her annual shots and The vet also informed me that she was ~5 months at the time. I couldn’t belive it especially sense she weighed only ~4lbs at the time. She did really well at the vet other than the interation where she hissed at a dog.\nThey told me she had not been spayed as well so we had to go get her spayed soon. I thought it was going to be too much, but my roommate was a great help as they told me, “The Humane Society gives out flyers that will allow her to get spayed for cheeper.” So that day I went down and got a spay voucher and even got her microchiped for ~$37 usd. That helped so much.\nI had to wait a long time for the Humane Society to make the appointment for me. But, the time they made it for was for Novmber 22 at 8:00am. The start of my Thanksgiving break. So she got spayed before Thanksgiving. I don’t think that is something to be thankful about though."

    "title": "Kant and Lying to the Drunk Friend Senario",
    "section": "Kant and Lying to the Drunk Friend Scenario",
    "text": "Kant and Lying to the Drunk Friend Scenario\n\nKant, a deontological moral philosopher, argues that the ground of morality is duty and obeying the categorical imperative (Kant 327). This imperative tells us that we should only act on the maxim we could will to be universal law (327). Another way of staying the categorical imperative is to say that we should treat people as an end in themselves and not just a means to our end (Kant 333). We can use Kant’s categorical imperative to help us understand the moral thing to do in situations like the Lying to the Drunk Friend Scenario. Kant would argue that the person in the Lying to the Drunk Friend Scenario (LDFS) is immoral but only due to the lie.\nTo understand why Kant would argue this, we must understand his moral theory. Firstly, morality isn’t grounded in empirical matters because morals are based on a priori reason and must be able to be applied universally to everyone and every situation. A priori reason is the knowledge we know from just reason alone (Kant 321-322). This a priori reason can also be used to understand the categorical imperative. The categorical imperative is the action is an end-in-itself (334). The categorical imperative tells us to only act on the maxim that we could will to be universal law (336). The categorical imperative can also be proven by the universality principle (“Kant & Categorical Imperatives: Crash Course Philosophy #35” 00:3:00–00:3:25). To quote Kant, “Act only according to that maxim which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law without contradiction (qtd. in “Kant & Categorical Imperatives: Crash Course Philosophy #35” 00:3:00–00:3:25).” Dr. Johnson points out about Kant, “when we act morally, we have autonomy of the will– The will is a law unto itself (Kant 342)(Kant, Part #3 7)” . Autonomy through this quote is being able to act upon yourself through your own reasoning, without anything else, forcing you or forcing a law on you. If someone were to force a law on you or outside of you, then it’s heteronomy (Kant 342).\nWith all these things being said about Kant’s theory then what would Kant about the LDFS. The LDFS presents a scenario where you are given a gun by your friend. After a while your friend comes back, drunk, and asks you to hand him the gun; as he wants to kill another friend, he had a fight with. Kant would say in this situation you could not lie. As the maximum of lying is unable to be universalized. Which intern goes against Kants theory of universality.\nA specific example that Kant uses about lying is (Kant & Categorical Imperatives: Crash Course Philosophy #35 00:5:01- 00:10:27) . If Elvira lies to the killer about where Tony is, Tony could be around the corner at the same time the killer decides to leave. This would have her responsible for Tony’s death. If she told the truth, then only the murderer would’ve been responsible for the deaths that occurred. The reason is she cannot control what the murderer does. She can only control what she does in the situation.\nBut if you give your friend the gun, then that Maxim would be giving your friend a gun. Which would allow them to murder someone meaning that guilt would be on you. So can’t would probably say in the situation that the best thing to do would be to not lie, but tell your friend, I am not giving you the gun because you’re drunk and also no matter what don’t give your friend the gun."
