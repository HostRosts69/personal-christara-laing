Welcome to my Personal Website!  It serves an example site for myself for CSC 324 at Georgetown College, as a warm up building your own website using the Quarto framework. This site will be revised even more so after my finals.
<img align="right" src="images/myart.jpg" width= 40%></img>

You can read a bit about me [here](about.html).

This website contains a bunch of stuff so far. About my cat Jinx and how she is amazing along with some stuff about me, code that I have already made, a game that I am going to make over the brake, a suggestion for my college calender to be fixed and so much more.

So please stay tuned to see what else this sight will have in store too!

#### My Social Medias:
I have a lot of them so here is my linktree of my socials. You can eather click or scan the qr code to see my link tree.
